#### **Times and Locations**

Tuesday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCB 2102

Thursday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCB 2102

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of
how populations and communities change through time and to provide fundamental 
concepts of how to forecast those changes. By the end of the semester, students will:

1)  Have an appreciation of the dynamics of species and communities.

2)  Understand the basic concepts of forecasting that apply across fields 
    and the challenges within ecology

3)  Have a basic understanding of working with time series data

#### **General Course Structure and Expectations**

This course is a mixture class discussion of primary literature and
hands-on experience involving some class activities. Completing assigned
readings, intellectual engagement with topics, and discussion
participation are the main ways students will learn in this class.
Tuesdays are typically concept discussion days. Thursdays will be a mix
of tools or concept discussion. You are expected to come prepared to
discuss the assigned papers.

#### **Course Grading**

80% of grade will be based on class participation, which includes leading one 
discussion during the semester 
20% will be based on completeion of class activities

#### **Attendance Policy**

Two days can be missed without impacts on your grade without the need
to submit make-up work, though we recommend that students attempt any 
missed class activities on their own time because additional class 
activities or discussions may rely on that knowledge. 

Up to 4 additional missed days can be made-up by submitting make-up work.
Class activities can be made-up on the student's time within a week by doing
the activity and submitting the code/data for instruvtor evaluation. Missed 
discussions can be made up by providing a written summary of the readings 
for the day(s) missed. Written summaries will involve 1-paragraph summary of the 
main questions and findings for each assigned paper and 1 paragraph applying the 
paper to how we think about either ecological dynamics or forecasting.

If a student anticpates missing more than 6 class days (i.e. 3 weeks of classes), you
must talk to the instructors beforehand.

#### **Course Materials**

1)  The free online text book [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) 
    will be used for some class activities, but is not required

2)  All reading materials will be made available through the [course website](https://weecology.github.io/forecasting-dynamics-course/). 
    

3)  Laptops: On class activity days, laptops will be required for class.


### **UF Policies**

#### **University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities**

Students requesting accommodation for disabilities must first register
with the Dean of Students Office (http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/). The Dean
of Students Office will provide documentation to the student who must
then provide this documentation to the instructor when requesting
accommodation. You must submit this documentation prior to submitting
assignments or taking the quizzes or exams. Accommodations are not
retroactive, therefore, students should contact the office as soon as
possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations.
