# Introductions

* Instructors
* Goals for the class
    * Forecasting is increasingly important
	* Difficult
	* Ecology hasn't historically done this well
	* Need to study dynamics in order to understand this
	* Need to learn how to work with dynamic data
	* Learn from other fields dealing with similar problems
* Students
    * What do you hope to get out of the class
	
# How the course will run

* Mix of paper discussion & R tutorials
* Grades - 100% participation
    * Leading one discussion
	* Participating in paper discussions in class
	* If you're worried that you aren't able to participate sufficiently let us know
	* Participating in R tutorials
* Discussion
    * Each student will lead one paper discussion
	* We will lead the rest
    * Discussion questions provided by Sunday night
* R tutorials
    * Introductions to methods for working with dynamic data and forecasting
	* I do, we do
	* We will demonstrate a concept, have you follow along on your computers,
      and then have you do something very similar in class

# Opening discussion

* Do we think we can forecast successfully in ecology?
