#### Comparing the Past to the Present
1. Based on the Pleistocene papers from last week, how do we expect geographic ranges to shift in response to climate change?
2. What are Parmesan et al seeing in range shifts today?
3. Does your expectation from the Pleistocene papers and the results from the Parmesan paper match? What does that tell us?

#### Reflect on their data given our discussion on data
1. What kind of data did they use? (hint, you need to look at the supplementary materials)
2. How do their data source(s) match up with our list? 
3. Do you think a similar approach to data could be used for other taxa?

#### A quick activity

1. Before coming to class, do a quick literature search on information about range shifts in response to climate change for the
taxonomic group of your choice. The goal isn't to be exhaustive, it's to help fuel a quasi-informed discussion about our current state of
knowledge 
     A. Have studies of range shifts been done for your organisms? 
     B. If so, what are people finding?
