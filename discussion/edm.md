1. What is a parametric model? What are its shortfalls?
2. What are some example of non-linear dynamics in ecology and/or the system you study? 
3. What is the problem of assuming linearity in non-linear systems and how does this affect our ability to forecast a system? How do we detect non-linearity?
4. What is empirical dynamic modeling? What are the benefits of using EDM? 
5. How does EDM differ from a parametric model? 
6. How did they apply EDM to salmon recruitment and what did they find?
7. What is the Lorenz attractor (from the video) and what are its benefits for forecasting? 
8. What challenges do empirical dynamic modeling addresses? 
9. How does EDM improve our ability to forecast systems?
