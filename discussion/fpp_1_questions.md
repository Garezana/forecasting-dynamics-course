## What can we forecast?

* What influences our ability to make good forecasts?
* What is the state of these influences for some ecological questions?
* Are there examples in ecology where a forecast could influence the thing being
  forecast?
  
## Forecasting, planning, and goals

* What do we want short-, medium-, and long-term forecasts for in ecology?
* What kinds of actual time-scales would these represent?
* How might these different forecast horizons influence our approaches to
  forecasting?

## Determining what to forecast

* How should we think about what to forecast in ecology?
* What kind of data would be need to collect to make good forecasts for these
  things?

## Forecasting data and methods

* What is a good example of cross-sectional forecasting in ecology?
* What is a good example of time-series forecasting?
* Why might we use a time-series only model for forecasting?

## Case studies

* How do the case studies relate to ecological patterns or questions?
* How complicated are the case studies compared to ecological problems?

## Basic steps

* What did you think of the basic steps?
* How well do you think ecology does at each of these steps?
* What can we do to improve on our current approaches?
