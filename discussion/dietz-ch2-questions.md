## Adding sources of uncertainty

* What is the difference between uncertainties and sources of variability?

## Sources of error

* What are the different sources of uncertainty? (list out on board)
* What is the distinction between uncertainties & sources of variation?
* Which of these are uncertainties vs. sources of variation?
    * What does the author mean when they say "if observation error was the only
      source of uncertainty then this forecast would have zero uncertainty"?
* How does this related to measurement error?
* Can uncertainty in initial conditions be reduced with more data?
* What is the difference between the additive process error and observation
  error?
* What information do covariance matrices provide?

## Model choice uncertainty

* What is model averaging?
* Has anyone every used model averaging in their research?

## Thinking probabilistically

* How do the boxes in the the graphical model of logistic growth relate to the
  sources of error?

## Predictability

* How does disturbance make forecasting difficult?
* What could be do to ameliorate the influence of disturbance on forecasts?

* Which components of uncertainty (e.g., in eq. 2.1) have the potential to grow
  through time?
* What implications does this have for our ability to forecast?
* What aspects of external drivers make systems easy vs. difficult to forecast?
* Are there implications of the need for different experimental designs for
  forecasting vs. hypothesis testing for how we should do science?
  
* What is the difference between parameter uncertainty and parameter variability?
* What are the implications for forecasting?
* How can we tell them apart?

* What kinds of uncertainty/variability do you think are most important in
  ecological systems?
* If a forecast model doesn't include all of these sources of variance can it be
  a valid forecast?
