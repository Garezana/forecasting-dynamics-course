* To start, let’s make sure we’re all on the same page re SDMs. What kind of information do they describe? What kinds of data goes into them? How (generally) do they generate predictions?
* Why do you think SDMs are so popular in attempts to forecast ecological change?
* How do SDM approaches think about uncertainty?
* What do the authors identify as the main challenges to testing the accuracy of predictions from SDMs? How does this project address those challenges?
* What is the temporal and spatial scale and quality of the occurrence and environmental datasets they use?
* They test a variety of specific approaches to generating SDMs. What (generally!) do these methods do?
* In evaluating the forecasts, the authors draw a distinction between transferability in time and predicting change. What’s the distinction? How do they evaluate each?
* How do the models do on transferability (Figure 1)? What about predicting change (Table 3)?
* What reasons do the authors suggest to explain the models’ predictive ability?
	* Of these, which do you think could be improved with better modeling techniques? Which ones would require information that we could collect? Information that we probably couldn’t? 
* Let’s think about SDMs in context of the other forecasting approaches we’ve discussed. 
	* What does a SDM “know” about the things it predicts? How does this compare to a Bayesian state-space model, or an EDM? What about the FiveThirtyEight models? Weather?
	* Given the kinds and amounts of information we can feasibly get, what kinds of processes do you think SDMs are best suited to describe? Are these the processes we’d like to use them to describe?
