* What is the "gap in the literature" that the authors are specifically trying to address with this paper?
* What predictions do the authors make? What rationale do they give to support these predictions?
* How did they go about answering their question?
* What data limitations did the authors face?
* Which of the five biodiversity metrics measured (see Fig. 2) are associated with species-level processes and which with community-level processes?
* Did their results match their predictions?
* What are compensatory dynamics? How might they be stabilizing community-level responses to disturbance?
* Think about how the results of this paper might (or might not) relate to the results in Tuesdayâ€™s paper (Dornelas et al., 2014). If you think they are comparable or related in some way, do the results of this paper compliment or contrast with Dornelas et al.?
* What do these findings mean for how we should forecast disturbed systems? How does this change based on what aspect/level of a system we are forecasting?
