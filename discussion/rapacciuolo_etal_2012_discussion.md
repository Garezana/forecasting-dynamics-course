## Analysis

* What analysis is done beyond just looking at the fit of the forecast to the
  data?

* How is this related to our discussion of baseline models in time-series
  analysis?

* What was the best overall approach to forecasting from SDMs

* Which of the factors looked at was most relevant to how accurate a forecast
  was?
