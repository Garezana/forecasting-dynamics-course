# Underlying paper

* What are El Ni√±o and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation?
* What is the main causal pathway through which SST is hypothesized to influence
  fire severity?
* The paper recognizes that a number of factors other than precipitation may be
  important. How does it deal with that?

* How long is the training time-series for FSS?
* What does this tell us about ecological forecasting?

* How far in advance are they forecasting fires?
* Is this useful?
* How well do you think they would do at forecasting further into the future?
* What might this tell us about ecological forecasting?

* How is the forecasting model built?
* How did they validate it (including both temporal and spatial validation)?
* What did they use additional measures of fire beyond just the MODIS based FSS?

* What might cause the time delays between SST anomalies and dry-season FSS
  intensity?
* Are these delays problematic or beneficial for forecasting?


# Operational forecasts

* This group makes forecasts every year based on their models and posts them
  publicly
* What does this accomplish for policy?
* What does this accomplish for science?
* Do you think they are rewarded for this by conventional academic systems?

* What do you think about who they communicate their forecasts?
* Does the site present forecasts at various points in advance?
* How to they present uncertainty?

* Do they present supplemental information beyond their forecasts?
* Is this helpful?

* Have they update the modeling approach since 2011?
