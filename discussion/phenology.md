1. What is phenology?
2. What are some of the ways that climate and phenology are linked?
3. This paper is very focused on land plants. Can you think of some examples of phenology for non-plants?
4. How big have the shifts in phenology been thus far?
    * What kind of data do you need to detect and forecast that magnitude of change?
    * Think back to our discussion on data types for forecasting, what type sof data give us that scale of resolution? What challenge do they identify later in the paper that inhibits using that type of fata collection for studying phenology?
    * Do you feel that its important or possible to forecast shifts that precisely?
5. Phenology has been studied for a very long time, but where are most of the long-term records from? What biases does this insert into our understanding of phenology?
6. The paper dedicated a section to discuss which family of models (theoertical, statistical, process oriented) is suitable for forecasting phenology. Each family has pros and cons. Which approach do you feel may be best? To answer which questions? Which of the approaches would you bet on for future development?
7. How often have you read the word 'uncertainty' in this paper?
