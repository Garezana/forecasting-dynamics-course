*Introduction*
* What is the trend reported by many recent studies correlating early spring phenology and temperature?
* What are the two new possibilities enabled by recent advances in species-specific phenological models?
* Phenology and climate are intimately linked
* In what way can global climate change influence phenology?
* What is a phenoclimatic measure and why is it relevant?

*Species-level phenology: observational networks*
* Why are long-term historical records important?
* What are the limitations of traditional methods that try to detect temporal changes in phenology?

*Ecosystem and global-scale phenology: remote sensing*
* What makes the use of satellites so important in the study of phenological responses to climate change?
* What are the two major challenges a researcher can encounter when working with satellite data? Are there ways to overcome these limitations?
* Implications for the global carbon cycle: atmospheric monitoring networks
* What is one of the main purposes of global change research?
* Disentangling the influences of multiple global changes: experiments
* What is the importance of controlling different environmental characteristics when studying global change?
* How can the increase in atmospheric carbon influence plants? Is there a singular pattern identified in the responses from plants to atmospheric carbon increase?
* From observation to prediction: modeling phenology
* What could be accomplished by applying accurate phenology predictions?

*Future directions: challenges and opportunities*
How are researchers dealing with integration of different scales (species-specific and regional) to predict global patterns of change?
