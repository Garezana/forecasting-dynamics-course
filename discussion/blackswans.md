* What are Black-swan events? And what do they mean in an ecological context?

* What is population dynamic? What factors addressed populations dynamics? What kind of data is necessary to understand population dynamics?

* Why Black-swan events are relevant for wild populations? What kind of data may be important for understanding Black-swan events in a forecasting context?

* What is the relevance of Black-swan events on a temporal scale? what about geographic scale?

* What are the causes – intrinsic and extrinsic - of the Black-swan events in animal populations? Can these causes be predicted?

* Do you remember any decline or crash – or maybe increase - population event that could be a Black-swan event?

* Why Black-swan population crashes are substantially more frequent that Black-swan population increases?

* Why do you think that birds, mammals, and insects are more vulnerable to population decreases in extreme events - black-swan event? What happen with other taxa?

* Which are the “cautions” described by the authors, and the effect in the forecasting context on their target animal populations?

* What conservation strategies are necessary to implement to conserve wild population in a Black-swan events forecasting?
