1. Before you had read the paper, what was your assumption about local species richness change? That it was generally declining? Generally increasing? Depended on the system? Why?
2. What does this paper say about local changes in richness?
3. Why might composition and richness exhibit different dynamics for the same community?
4. What types of communities are used in this paper? What types of data? Would you expect to see different results in different types of systems?
