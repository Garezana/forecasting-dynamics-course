* What is the difference between temporal alpha diversity and temporal beta diversity? What is the relationship between alpha and beta diversity and biodiversity?
* Under what circumstances is increasing local alpha diversity be a bad thing for an ecosystem?
* According to the authors, “An analysis of slopes by climatic regions reveals that temperate time series have a significantly positive trend [in species richness], and time series sampled at a global scale show a significantly negative trend [in species richness].” What could be driving these differences?
* A recent paper by Valiente-Banuet et al. (2015) suggests that the loss of species does not always cause a 1:1 loss of ecological interactions. Some species may be involved in redundant interactions, while other may be involved in keystone interactions. With this in mind, how does this affect our interpretation of biodiversity and community turnover?
* What is the role of invasive species in biodiversity and community turnover?
* What is the implication of these findings for future forecasting? How would changes in community composition impact ecological interactions, and what would be the result on forecasts based on past data?
* What is meant by a “shifting baseline,” and how might a “shifting baseline” impact forecasting? What role does data availability play in the “shifting baseline”.
* Is our tendency to talk about the benefits of biodiversity simply an issue of semantics, or is it representative of a deeper outlook problem in the scientific community? Do the findings of this paper impact how conservationists should frame our goals in terms of ecosystem protection? Should more of an influence be placed on ecosystem function than maintaining biodiversity?
